This project demonstrates the implementation of real-time facial emotion recognition using the 
`deepface` library and OpenCV. The objective is to capture live video from a webcam, identify faces 
within the video stream, and predict the corresponding emotions for each detected face. The 
emotions predicted are displayed in real-time on the video frames.
To streamline this process, we've utilized the `deepface` library, a deep learning-based facial analysis 
tool that employs pre-trained models for accurate emotion detection. TensorFlow is the underlying 
framework for the deep learning operations. Additionally, we leverage OpenCV, an open-source 
computer vision library, to facilitate image and video processing.
